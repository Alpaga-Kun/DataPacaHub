' Data Source: Represents the sources from which data is extracted. Attributes include a unique ID, name, type (e.g., API, Database, Web), and details about the data source.
' Extracted Data: Contains details about the data extracted from various sources. It includes a unique ID, a reference to the Data Source ID (source_id), the date of extraction, and the raw data blob.
' Processed Data: Stores information about data after it has been processed or transformed. Attributes include a unique ID, a reference to the Extracted Data ID (extracted_data_id), the date of processing, and the processed data blob.
' Visualization: Details about the visualizations created from processed data. It includes a unique ID, a reference to the Processed Data ID (processed_data_id), the creation date, the type of visualization, and additional details.

' A Data Source can have multiple Extracted Data records (one-to-many relationship).
' Each Extracted Data record can be transformed into multiple Processed Data records (one-to-many relationship).
' Each Processed Data record can be used in multiple Visualizations (one-to-many relationship).
