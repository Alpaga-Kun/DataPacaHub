' Select Data Source: Users can select from available data source plugins for their ETL tasks.
' Add Data Source Plugin: Users have the ability to add new plugins to the system for extracting data from new sources.
' Remove Data Source Plugin: Similarly, users can remove existing plugins if they are no longer needed.
' Extract Data: Once data sources are selected, users can initiate the data extraction process.
' Process Data: After extraction, data can be processed or transformed to meet the requirements for analysis.
' Visualize Data: Finally, users can request visualization of the processed data to gain insights and inform decision-making.
