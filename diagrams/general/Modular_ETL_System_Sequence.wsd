' Initialization: The user starts the ETL system, which then loads the Plugin Manager.
' Plugin Management: The user interacts with the Plugin Manager to select the data sources they wish to use. This includes the ability to add or remove data source plugins as needed.
' Data Extraction: The selected plugins extract raw data from their respective sources.
' Data Processing: The extracted data is then processed or transformed to improve its quality and make it usable for analysis.
' Data Visualization: Finally, the processed data is visualized to provide insights, which can inform decision-making processes.
